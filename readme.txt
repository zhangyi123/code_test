1) In the attached file (w_data.dat), you’ll find daily weather data.   Download this text file, then write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).

 

2) The attached soccer.dat file contains the results from the English Premier League.  The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.

 

Is the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?
